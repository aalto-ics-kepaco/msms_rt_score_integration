# Results

Raw result files, as outputed by the run-scripts "eval__*" (see here: [CASMI (2016)](/msmsrt_scorer/experiments/CASMI_2016) and [EA Massbank](/msmsrt_scorer/experiments/EA_Massbank)), are provided for both datasets (CASMI and EA) in the respective subfolders "results__*". 

Furthermore, the IPython Notebooks ("plots_and_tables*.ipynb") allow to reproduce the figures and tables of the paper directly from the raw data. 

## Raw result Files

The directories corresponding to both datasets contain the raw result files for different settings:
