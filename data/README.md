# (MS2, RT)-tuple Database

All data used in our experiments is organized in SQLite DB. The database can be
downloaded from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4305918) (temporarly download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HKooW9p6huiKFt4k9jhX80k6GsmHI9yE/view?usp=sharing)) (~12GB). Its layout as well as content is described here.   

## General Information

The database was build around the [publicly available MS2 scores](https://sourceforge.net/p/casmi/web/HEAD/tree/web/2016/contest/submissions/)
of the various metabolite identification approaches that participated in the
[CASMI 2016 challenge](http://www.casmi-contest.org/2016/index.shtml) for a set
of 208 MS2 spectra. Later, the MS2 data, used by
[Ruttkies et al. 2016](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0115-9)
for the development of their MS2 + RT score integration framework, was added to
 the database as well.

### Retention Time Datasets

The RankSVM training retention times are _not_ part of this database, but rather
the preference scores predicted by the RankSVM models (see Section 3.2), for the
molecular candidate structures.

## Database Layout

![database_layout](/data/db_layout.png)

### (MS2, RT)-tuples

The table ```challenges``` contains entries corresponding to the datasets used
in our publication (see Section 3.1 and Table 1): CASMI 2016, **positive** and
**negative**; Massbank EA, **EA_positive** and **EA_negative**.

To each challenge the set of spectra can be found in the table ```spectra```. It
contains information about the measured molecule, ionization, spectrum-id,
retention-time etc. Currently, the peak lists, i.e. the actual spectra,
are not stored in the database, but can be found in the [spectra directory](/data/spectra/).

### Candidate Sets

The spectra are associated with their molecular candidates in the table
```candidates_spectra```.

### Representation of the Molecules

All molecules in the database, i.e. candidates and ground truth structures for
the spectra, are stored in the ```molecules``` table. They are indexed (table key) by their
InChI provided by the original creators of the dataset. Furthermore, this table
contains the molecules 2D-InChI, SMILES, molecular formula and references to
exernal databases such as ChemSpider and PubChem (if available).

Across the whole database, the InChI is used as index of the molecules, e.g. for
the fingerprints, candidates, etc., typically refered to as *molecule* column.

#### InChI as Representation for the Molecules

While constructing the database, the structure representation used to calculate
molecular fingerprints or descriptors are InChIs. Even though the database
contains SMILES (canonical and isomeric), those SMILES are calculated from the
InChI representation using [RDKit Python package](http://rdkit.org/docs/api-docs.html):
[MolFromInChI](http://rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.inchi.html#rdkit.Chem.inchi.MolFromInchi)
-> MolToSmiles. This protocol was chosen as some retention time databases only
provide InChI representations.

### Molecular Features

Two molecular feature representations are provided within the database.

#### Molecular Fingerprints (FPS)

Molecular fingerprints describe a molecule by a vector indicating the presence
respectively the count of a set of molecular substructures. The meta description
of the provided fingerprints can be found in table ```fingerprints_meta```. In
total five different fingerprint definitions are in the database (```fingerprints_data```):
- **substructure_count**: Counts of 307 FPS calculated using CDK and
  used for the RankSVM order predictions (see Section 3.2)
- **morgan_***: ECFP and FCFP fingerprints calcualted using RDKit used to study
  the expected similarity for Only MS and MS + RT (not in the paper)
- **iokr_fps__***: Fingerprints used for the positve and negative IOKR models.
  Those have been calculated using CDK and encompass the same FPS definitions as
  in [DÃ¼hrkop et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0344-8)

The molecular fingerprints are computed for all rows in ```molecules```.

#### Molecular Descriptors

Molecular descriptors calculate meaningful characteristics of molecules, e.g.
LogP, that can be used as input for machine learning prediction tasks. In the
table ```descriptors_meta``` we summarize the provided descriptors and the
corresponding data is available in ```descriptors_data```. However, as the
descriptors where not used in the publication, they are currently only provided
for all molecular structures associated with the CASMI datraset. All descriptors
where calculated using RDKit.

### Spectra Scores

In the database we store the MS2 scores with all spectra typically calculated
with multiple metabolite identification frameworks. Referring to the CASMI
challenge we call the different frameworks *participants* and an overview can
be found in the ```participants``` table. For our publication only 
**MetFrag_2.4.5__*** and **IOKR__696a17f3** are relevant (see Section 3.3).

#### CASMI 2016

For the CASMI dataset, the database contains the MetFrag scores using only
the ```FragmenterScore``` feature (**MetFrag_2.4.5__8afe4a14**) and the IOKR scores
(**IOKR__696a17f3**). Furthermore, it countains combined scores:

(1- D) * ```FragmenterScore``` + D *  ```RetentionTimeScore```

for different values of D. The combination has been directly computed using the
MetFrag software. Check the *description* column in the ```participants``` table 
for details. 

#### Massbank EA

For the Massbank EA dataset, the database contains the MetFrag scores using only
the ```FragmenterScore``` feature (**MetFrag_2.4.5__8afe4a14**) and the IOKR scores
(**IOKR__696a17f3**). The values of MetFrag's ```RetentionTimeScore``` feature are
currently not in the database, but can be found [here](/data/metfrag_RetentionTimeScore_EA)
for each random sample, 50x negative and 100x positive mode (see Section 3.1).

### Preference Scores

The preference scores are related to the retention order, i.e., the predicted 
retention orders can be directly extracted by the combination of two preference
values. To understand this, please read in Section 2.2.3 and specifically Eq. (2). 
One can see, that the RankSVM model (w) can be used to predict the retention order
of two molecular structures by calculating: w^T(phi_i - phi_j). This can be also
expressed as: w^T phi_i - w^T phi_j. Therefore, the order is predicted through 
the difference of the two preference values w^T phi_i and w^T phi_j. That means,
it is sufficient to store the preference values, calculated using the RankSVM, 
for each molecular candidate structure in the database. The pairwise order 
predictions, can subsequently be calculated on demand. 

An description of the RankSVM models used in the paper can be found in the
```preference_scores_meta``` table. For the CASMI dataset, multiple RankSVM 
models using different RT datasets (*training_dataset* column) habe been 
trained. However, only the *MEOH_AND_CASMI* has finally been used. For the 
Massbank EA dataset, we used the same RT dataset (*MEOH_AND_CASMI_JOINT*
and *MEOH_AND_CASMI* are essentially the same) for the RankSVM training,
but we trained different models for each random subsample to make the best
use of the available RT training data. Section 3.1 and 3.2 of the paper 
should be read for a better understanding.

The preference scores for all molecular structures are in the ```preference_scores_data```
table.

## Summary and Potential of the Database

We created the database mainly to easy the data handling and reduce errors
introduced by mergin different data sources. It provides a unifyed view on the
data, ensuring that, e.g., the same molecular representation is used througout the
various framework-steps. 

We hope, that the database might has a value in it self for other researchers,
who might can use some parts of it in their own work. Many details are probably
missing from this readme, but please contact us, if you want to use the data,
but you need to ensure how exactly some data has been processed or calculated. 

The scripts to set up the database from the original data respectively the 
implementation of the fingerprint and descriptor calculation are not part of this 
repository, but can be provided on demand.
